#### Team Members:

  * Pratik Pathak
  * Mikey Esteban
  * Zane Christopher Lynch
#### Proposal Date: 11/2/19
#### Due Date: 11/7/19
### Statement of work: Pokemon Database
  * Using Databases we have found, we aim to create a more dynamic and functional trainer database that allows users to search for trainers and pull up their information, including their pokemon and pokemon levels.
  * Users will also be able to pull up a detailed sheet on each pokemon in a trainerâ€™s team through a join linked to the pokemon database we have formatted. This allows both regular and detailed views for each pokemon and trainer and allows for searching a trainer through multiple variables.
  * We plan to structure our databases in a way that allows for easily editing and updating data because pokemon and trainers are stored separately. As the game involves, pokemon information is updated constantly but this database can be updated alongside the games without breaking the scripts.
